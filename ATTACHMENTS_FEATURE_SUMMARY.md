# File Attachments Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a dynamic file upload system for the student application portal that allows users to attach up to 20 supporting documents with their applications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
**Migration:** `2025_10_03_002530_add_attachments_to_student_applications_table.php`
- Added `attachments` column (JSON, nullable) to `student_applications` table
- Positioned after `uploaded_documents` column
- Migration executed successfully (66.15ms)

### 2. Model Updates
**File:** `app/Models/StudentApplication.php`
- Added `'attachments'` to `$fillable` array
- Added `'attachments' => 'array'` to `$casts` array for automatic JSON encoding/decoding

### 3. Bio-Data Form UI
**File:** `resources/views/student-application/bio-data-form.blade.php`

**HTML Structure:**
- Added "Supporting Documents (Optional)" section before form actions
- File list container (`#attachmentsList`) for displaying selected files
- "Add Another Document" button with counter
- Information alert showing accepted formats, size limits, and max files

**JavaScript Features:**
- Dynamic file input creation (up to 20 files)
- Real-time file validation:
  - Type: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, DOC, DOCX
  - Size: Max 5MB per file
  - Count: Max 20 files
- File preview with icons, names, and sizes
- Individual file removal functionality
- Button state management (shows count and disables at limit)
- File icon assignment based on MIME type
- XSS protection with HTML escaping

**CSS Styling:**
- Professional attachment item cards with hover effects
- Color-coded file type icons (PDF: red, Images: green, Docs: blue)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Smooth transitions and animations

### 4. Controller Updates
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/StudentApplicationController.php`
**Method:** `saveBioData()`

**New Functionality:**
- Added file validation rule: `'attachments.*' => 'nullable|file|max:5120|mimes:pdf,jpg,jpeg,png,doc,docx'`
- File upload handling with try-catch error handling
- Unique filename generation: `{timestamp}_{uniqid}.{extension}`
- Files stored in: `storage/app/public/applications/{application_number}/`
- Metadata saved as JSON array:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "original_filename.pdf",
      "stored_name": "1234567890_abc123.pdf",
      "path": "applications/APP-2025-000001/1234567890_abc123.pdf",
      "size": 12345,
      "type": "application/pdf",
      "uploaded_at": "2025-01-03 10:30:00"
    }
  ]
  ```
- Merges with existing attachments if any
- Enforces 20-file limit at server level
- Error messages for upload failures

### 5. Confirmation View Updates
**File:** `resources/views/student-application/confirmation.blade.php`

**Features:**
- New "Supporting Documents" section (only shown if attachments exist)
- Professional attachment cards with:
  - Color-coded file type icons
  - Original filename
  - File size (KB)
  - Upload date
  - "View" button to open/download file
- Links to files using `asset('storage/' . $attachment['path'])`
- Responsive layout (stacks vertically on mobile)

**CSS Styling:**
- Consistent with bio-data form styling
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Mobile-responsive design
- Proper icon colors matching file types

## Technical Specifications

### File Constraints
- **Maximum Files:** 20 attachments per application
- **Maximum Size:** 5MB per file
- **Allowed Types:**
  - PDF (.pdf)
  - Images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
  - Word Documents (.doc, .docx)

### Storage Structure
```
storage/app/public/
└── applications/
    └── {application_number}/
        ├── {timestamp}_{uniqid}.pdf
        ├── {timestamp}_{uniqid}.jpg
        └── ...
```

### Security Features
- Server-side file validation (type, size, count)
- Client-side pre-validation for better UX
- Unique filename generation prevents overwrites
- XSS protection with HTML escaping
- Secure file storage outside web root (symlinked)
- Error logging for debugging

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- File API support required
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## User Experience
1. User clicks "Add Another Document" button
2. File picker opens with filtered file types
3. Selected file is validated (type, size)
4. File appears in list with icon, name, size
5. User can remove any file before submission
6. Button shows current count (e.g., "5/20")
7. Button disables at 20-file limit
8. Form submits with files via multipart/form-data
9. Files uploaded to server with progress feedback
10. Confirmation page shows all uploaded documents
11. User can view/download any attachment
