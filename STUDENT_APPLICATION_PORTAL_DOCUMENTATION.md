## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues:
1. **Session timeout too fast:** Adjust `sessionTimeRemaining` in JavaScript (currently 7200s = 2hrs)
2. **File upload fails:** Check PHP max_upload_filesize and post_max_size in php.ini
3. **Auto-save not working:** Check JavaScript console for errors, verify CSRF token
4. **School not appearing:** Verify `accepts_online_applications = 'Yes'` in enterprises table

### Database Maintenance:
- Old draft applications can be cleaned up after 30 days: `DELETE FROM student_applications WHERE status = 'draft' AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY`
- Archive old applications: Move accepted/rejected to archive table after 1 year
