## Components

### 1. PaymentProcessingService
**Location:** `app/Services/PaymentProcessingService.php`

Core service that handles all payment processing with these methods:

#### `processCreditPurchase(CreditPurchase $creditPurchase)`
Processes credit purchases when payment is approved.

**Safety Features:**
- Validates payment status is "Paid"
- Checks if already deposited (prevents double processing)
- Verifies amount is valid
- Checks for duplicate wallet records
- Uses database transactions
- Logs all actions

**Process:**
1. Validate payment approved
2. Check if already processed
3. Verify amount and enterprise
4. Check for duplicate wallet records
5. Create wallet record
6. Mark as deposited
7. Log success

#### `processServiceSubscription(ServiceSubscription $subscription)`
Processes service subscription items after payment.

**Safety Features:**
- Checks if already processed
- Validates each item before processing
- Skips already processed items
- Tracks success/failure counts
- Uses database transactions
- Detailed error tracking

**Process:**
1. Check if already processed
2. Validate subscription and items
3. Process each item individually
4. Create new subscriptions for each item
5. Mark items as processed
6. Mark parent subscription as processed
7. Log all activities

#### `processProjectShares($projectShare)`
Processes project share allocations after payment.

**Safety Features:**
- Validates payment status
- Checks for duplicate processing
- Verifies all required fields
- Uses database transactions
- Comprehensive logging

#### `processInsuranceSubscription($insuranceSubscription)`
Processes insurance subscriptions and generates policies.

**Safety Features:**
- Validates payment status
- Checks for duplicate subscriptions
- Validates insurance period
- Generates unique policy numbers
- Uses database transactions
- Full audit trail

### 2. Updated Models

#### CreditPurchase Model
**Location:** `app/Models/CreditPurchase.php`

**Auto-Processing:**
```php
// Automatically triggered when payment_status changes to 'Paid'
self::updated(function ($m) {
    if ($m->isDirty('payment_status') && $m->payment_status === 'Paid') {
        PaymentProcessingService::processCreditPurchase($m);
    }
});
```

**New Fields:**
- `processed_at` - Timestamp of processing
- `deposit_status` - 'Diposited' or 'Not Diposited'

**New Methods:**
- `isProcessed()` - Check if processed
- `isPaid()` - Check if payment approved

#### ServiceSubscription Model
**Location:** `app/Models/ServiceSubscription.php`

**Updated Processing:**
```php
// Old method now uses PaymentProcessingService
function do_process() {
    return \App\Services\PaymentProcessingService::processServiceSubscription($this);
}
```

**New Fields:**
- `processed_at` - Timestamp of processing
- `processed_count` - Number of items successfully processed
- `failed_count` - Number of items that failed

### 3. Database Migration
**Location:** `database/migrations/2025_10_28_120000_add_processing_fields_to_payment_tables.php`

**Adds tracking fields to:**
- `credit_purchases`
  - `processed_at`
  
- `service_subscriptions`
  - `processed_at`
  - `processed_count`
  - `failed_count`
  
- `service_subscription_items`
  - `processed_at`
  - `processed_subscription_id`
  
- `project_shares` (if exists)
  - `is_processed`
  - `processed_at`
  
- `insurance_subscriptions` (if exists)
  - `is_processed`
  - `processed_at`
  - `policy_number`
  - `status`

## How It Works

### Credit Purchase Flow

```
1. Admin creates credit purchase record
   ↓
2. Admin changes payment_status to "Paid"
   ↓
3. Model's updated() event fires
   ↓
4. PaymentProcessingService::processCreditPurchase() called
   ↓
5. System validates:
   - Payment is approved ✓
   - Not already deposited ✓
   - Amount is valid ✓
   - No duplicate wallet records ✓
   ↓
6. Within database transaction:
   - Create wallet record
   - Mark as deposited
   - Set processed_at timestamp
   ↓
7. Log success
   ↓
8. Credit immediately available in wallet
```

### Service Subscription Flow

```
1. Service subscription created with items
   ↓
2. Payment approved (payment_status = 'Paid')
   ↓
3. Admin calls do_process() or auto-trigger
   ↓
4. PaymentProcessingService::processServiceSubscription() called
   ↓
5. System validates:
   - Not already processed ✓
   - Items exist ✓
   ↓
6. For each item (within database transaction):
   - Validate service exists ✓
   - Skip if already processed ✓
   - Create new individual subscription
   - Mark item as processed
   - Track success/failure
   ↓
7. Mark parent subscription as processed
   ↓
8. Log results (processed count, failed count)
   ↓
9. All subscriptions active
```

### Project Shares Flow

```
1. Project share purchase created
   ↓
2. Payment approved (payment_status = 'Paid')
   ↓
3. PaymentProcessingService::processProjectShares() called
   ↓
4. System validates:
   - Payment approved ✓
   - Not already processed ✓
   - Valid amount ✓
   - Valid enterprise & administrator ✓
   ↓
5. Within database transaction:
   - Create share records
   - Update ownership percentages
   - Record transactions
   - Mark as processed
   ↓
6. Log success
   ↓
7. Shares allocated
```

### Insurance Subscription Flow

```
1. Insurance subscription created
   ↓
2. Payment approved (payment_status = 'Paid')
   ↓
3. PaymentProcessingService::processInsuranceSubscription() called
   ↓
4. System validates:
   - Payment approved ✓
   - Not already processed ✓
   - Valid amount ✓
   - Valid period ✓
   ↓
5. Within database transaction:
   - Generate unique policy number
   - Process insurance items
   - Activate coverage
   - Mark as processed
   - Set status to 'Active'
   ↓
6. Log success
   ↓
7. Insurance active with policy number
```

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Database Transactions
All processing happens within `DB::transaction()`:
```php
DB::transaction(function() {
    // All operations here
    // If ANY fails, ALL rollback
});
```

### 2. Double Processing Prevention

**Multiple Layers:**
- Check `is_processed` flag before starting
- Check `deposit_status` for credit purchases
- Check for duplicate wallet records
- Check for duplicate subscriptions
- Skip already processed items
- Timestamp tracking with `processed_at`

**Example:**
```php
// Layer 1: Check flag
if ($subscription->is_processed === 'Yes') {
    return ['already_processed' => true];
}

// Layer 2: Check timestamp
if ($subscription->processed_at !== null) {
    return ['already_processed' => true];
}

// Layer 3: Check duplicate records
$existing = WalletRecord::where([...])->first();
if ($existing) {
    return ['already_processed' => true];
}
```

### 3. Validation at Every Step

**Before Processing:**
- Payment status must be "Paid"
- Amount must be positive
- Enterprise ID must be valid
- Administrator ID must be valid
- Required relationships must exist

**During Processing:**
- Service exists
- Account exists
- No duplicate records
- Sufficient data

**After Processing:**
- Records created successfully
- Balances updated
- Timestamps set
- Logs written

### 4. Error Handling

**Try-Catch Blocks:**
```php
try {
    // Processing logic
} catch (Exception $e) {
    Log::error('Processing failed', [
        'error' => $e->getMessage(),
        'trace' => $e->getTraceAsString()
    ]);
    throw $e; // Triggers DB rollback
}
```

**Graceful Failures:**
- Individual item failures don't stop batch processing
- Failed items are tracked and reported
- Errors are logged with full context
- Processing continues for valid items

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

**What's Logged:**
- Every processing attempt
- Success/failure status
- Timestamp of each action
- Record IDs involved
- Amounts processed
- Error messages and stack traces
- User who triggered action

**Log Levels:**
- `info` - Successful processing
- `warning` - Non-critical issues
- `error` - Processing failures

## Usage Examples

### Manual Processing (if needed)

```php
use App\Services\PaymentProcessingService;
use App\Models\CreditPurchase;

// Process a credit purchase
$creditPurchase = CreditPurchase::find($id);
$result = PaymentProcessingService::processCreditPurchase($creditPurchase);

if ($result['success']) {
    echo "Processed successfully!";
    echo "Wallet Record ID: " . $result['wallet_record_id'];
} else {
    echo "Failed: " . $result['message'];
}
```

```php
// Process service subscription
$subscription = ServiceSubscription::find($id);
$result = PaymentProcessingService::processServiceSubscription($subscription);

echo "Processed: " . $result['processed_count'];
echo "Failed: " . $result['failed_count'];
```

### Checking Processing Status

```php
// Credit Purchase
$purchase = CreditPurchase::find($id);
if ($purchase->isProcessed()) {
    echo "Already processed at: " . $purchase->processed_at;
}

// Service Subscription
$subscription = ServiceSubscription::find($id);
if ($subscription->is_processed === 'Yes') {
    echo "Processed: " . $subscription->processed_count . " items";
    echo "Failed: " . $subscription->failed_count . " items";
    echo "Processed at: " . $subscription->processed_at;
}
```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This adds all necessary tracking fields to payment tables.

### 2. Clear Cache
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### 3. Test Auto-Processing

**Test Credit Purchase:**
```php
$purchase = CreditPurchase::create([
    'enterprise_id' => 1,
    'amount' => 10000,
    'payment_status' => 'Not Paid',
    'deposit_status' => 'Not Diposited'
]);

// Approve payment (triggers auto-processing)
$purchase->payment_status = 'Paid';
$purchase->save();

// Check if processed
echo $purchase->fresh()->deposit_status; // Should be 'Diposited'
```

---

## API Response Format

All processing methods return a consistent response:

```php
[
    'success' => true|false,           // Overall success status
    'message' => 'Description',        // Human-readable message
    'processed' => true|false,         // Whether processing occurred
    'already_processed' => true|false, // If already processed (optional)
    'processed_count' => 5,            // Items processed (optional)
    'failed_count' => 1,               // Items failed (optional)
    'errors' => [],                    // Array of error messages (optional)
    'wallet_record_id' => 123,         // Created record ID (optional)
    'policy_number' => 'INS-2025-000001' // Generated policy number (optional)
]
```

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Logs
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "payment\|processing\|credit\|subscription"
```

### View Processing Status
```sql
-- Credit purchases pending processing
SELECT * FROM credit_purchases 
WHERE payment_status = 'Paid' 
AND deposit_status != 'Diposited';

-- Service subscriptions pending processing
SELECT * FROM service_subscriptions 
WHERE is_processed = 'No';

-- Recently processed items
SELECT * FROM service_subscriptions 
WHERE is_processed = 'Yes' 
AND processed_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
ORDER BY processed_at DESC;
```

### Check for Duplicates
```sql
-- Duplicate wallet records (should be 0)
SELECT enterprise_id, details, COUNT(*) as count
FROM wallet_records
GROUP BY enterprise_id, details
HAVING count > 1;

-- Duplicate subscriptions (should be 0)
SELECT service_id, administrator_id, due_term_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM service_subscriptions
WHERE is_processed = 'Yes'
GROUP BY service_id, administrator_id, due_term_id
HAVING count > 1;
```

## Error Recovery

### If Processing Fails

1. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

2. **Verify Data:**
   - Payment status is "Paid"
   - Record not already processed
   - All required fields filled
   - Related records exist

3. **Manual Retry:**
   ```php
   $purchase = CreditPurchase::find($id);
   $result = PaymentProcessingService::processCreditPurchase($purchase);
   ```

4. **Check Database State:**
   - Transaction may have been rolled back
   - No partial records should exist
   - All-or-nothing guarantee

---

## Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Always check return value from processing methods
- Log important processing events
- Monitor processing status regularly
- Run regular duplicate checks
- Keep audit trail clean

### DON'T ❌
- Don't process manually without checking `is_processed` flag
- Don't bypass the payment processing service
- Don't modify `processed_at` timestamps manually
- Don't delete processed records
- Don't run processing outside database transactions

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Already processed" error
**Cause:** Record has already been processed
**Solution:** This is working as intended - prevents double processing

### "Payment not approved" error
**Cause:** payment_status is not "Paid"
**Solution:** Approve the payment first

### "Duplicate transaction" error
**Cause:** Attempting to create duplicate record
**Solution:** This is working as intended - prevents duplicates

### Processing not triggering automatically
**Check:**
1. Is `payment_status` changing to "Paid"?
2. Are model events firing?
3. Check logs for errors
4. Verify service is being called
